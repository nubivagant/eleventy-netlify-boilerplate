## What's this all about?
FG camp ’21 highlighted the feeling echoed by many, new and old, that we’re missing a shared sense of what good looks like. To help, we’re creating a safe space to bring positive critique to our craft, through monthly debates. We'll pick apart an element of practice to dispel the dogma and explore the edges of what good looks like. All with passion and care.

## Why does this matter?
We believe that for the quality of our work to increase, we need to create, encourage and celebrate healthy tension in our practice and take hold of this shared understanding. In order to do that, we need psychological safety. In an org sense, it can simply be the feeling that it’s ok be vulnerable in front of each other, try new things, take risks. What better way to encourage that than to talk 'shop'?

These debates are a way to start embracing what it means to be a learning-organisation – something central to delivering our mission in a sustainable way. Cross-team small group meetings feel like a good way to weave this in as a start: just enough structure to matter, more than enough value driven back into project work to count.

## How does it work?
Monthly sessions of 45 minutes in duration see a topic put into the spotlight for debate. These will be sourced in advance, and to be considered will require a pledge from at least one person to represent each side (one in support, one for an alternative). The discussions will be facilitated to help tease out the tensions and get to the good stuff.

> ### Debate constraints:
> Each 'side' will be permitted a maximum of: 1 slide + 1 quote + 1 link or > other artefact, to help illustrate their debate.
> <p>(slides are heavily discouraged in favour of discourse)</p>

## I’m in, so what’s up for debate?
Anything and everything! It might be an approach, a model, a skill. From the way we conduct research, to the way we generate ideas. The only ask is that it’s applicable to the work we do and in the contexts we operate within.
